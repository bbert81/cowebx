#Rich Text Editor Demo

##About

This rich text editor application functions similarly to the `cowebx/cowebx-apps/coedit`. This version of the editor uses a DOM tree representation of the rich text internally. This change helps alleviate some of the bugs discovered in the `coedit` demo.

##Quick Start

1. If you haven't already, follow [these instructions](http://opencoweb.org/ocwdocs/tutorial/install.html) to deploy a Coweb instance.
2. After installing either the Java server in the step above, make sure to deploy the [cowebx demos](http://opencoweb.org/ocwdocs/tutorial/install.html#deploying-the-cowebx-demos-optional).
3. Start the coweb server instance as instructed in the installation guide above.
4. Visit the app in your browser, which by default is located at [http://localhost:8080/coeditDom](http://localhost:8080/coeditDom/index.html).
