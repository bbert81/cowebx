<h1>Co-Map Example</h1>
<p>Explore and annotate a map with other users. Your map viewport is independent of other users until sync'ed. Dropped markers are visible to and editable by all users at all times.</p>
<h2>Map</h2>
<p>Double-click the map to drop a marker. Left-click a marker to see its details. Left-click and drag a marker to move it to a new location. Double-click a marker to call attention to it.</p>

<p>Click the <em>Sync here</em> button to set all other users to your current location, zoom, and map type. Enable <em>Sync always</em> to have all users follow your map as it pans, zooms, and changes type.</p> 
<h2>Chat</h2>
<p>Enter text messages to converse with other users. Enter URLs starting with <em>http</em> to share links.</p>
<h2>Map Log</h2>
<p>Review actions taken by participants on the map. Click latitude / longitude links to jump to the location on the map.</p>
<h2>Features to Try</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Have two or more people pick-up the same marker. Have each person drop the marker in a different location at the same time. The marker should appear in the same location for all users after all outstanding events are processed. This is the effect of the operation engine when resolving conflicting edits.</li>
  <li>Click a marker to open its info window. Notice the visitor count information updates regularly. This is the effect of a coweb bot pushing simulated real-time data to the application.</li>
