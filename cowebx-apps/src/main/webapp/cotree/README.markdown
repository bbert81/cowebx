#Coweb Tree Application

##About

Collaborative tree demonstrating OpenCoweb's ability to keep multiple complex data structures in sync.

##Quick Start

1. If you haven't already, follow [these instructions](http://opencoweb.org/ocwdocs/tutorial/install.html) to deploy a Coweb instance.
2. Clone the CowebX repository:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:opencoweb/cowebx
```
3. Start a coweb server instance.
4. Visit the app in your browser.

###Directory Structure 

The structure of this directory is extremely straight forward. The following files are all you need to worry about when developing:

* ```index.html``` : serves as the main html file of the application
* ```application.js``` : serves as the main javascript file of the application
* ```application.css``` : serves as the main CSS of the application
